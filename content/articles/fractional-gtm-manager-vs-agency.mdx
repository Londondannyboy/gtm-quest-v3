# Fractional GTM Manager vs GTM Agency: Which Should You Hire?

Choosing between a fractional GTM manager and a GTM agency depends on your internal resources, budget, and strategic needs. Here's a comprehensive comparison to help you decide.

## What Are They?

### Fractional GTM Manager

A part-time strategic leader (typically fractional CMO/VP Marketing level):

- 10-30 hours/week commitment
- Sets GTM strategy and direction
- Manages internal team
- Makes strategic decisions
- Reports directly to founder/CEO
- **Cost:** $3K-$15K/month

### GTM Agency

Full-service execution team:

- Dedicated team assigned to your account
- Strategy + execution combined
- Project-based or retained engagement
- Execute campaigns directly
- Report on metrics and results
- **Cost:** $10K-$100K+/month

## Key Differences

| Factor | Fractional Manager | GTM Agency |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Strategic Focus | Yes, heavy | Yes, but less |
| Execution | Manages internal team | Executes directly |
| Full-time Equivalent | 0.25-0.75 FTE | 2-10+ FTE |
| Decision Making | High authority | Limited authority |
| Cost | $3K-$15K | $10K-$100K+ |
| Commitment | Usually flexible | Usually 3-6+ months |
| Learning Transfer | High | Medium |
| Speed to Results | Medium | Fast |
| Scalability | Limited | High |

## When to Hire a Fractional GTM Manager

A fractional manager is right when:

- You have an internal marketing/sales team that needs leadership
- You need strategic direction and experienced guidance
- Limited budget ($3K-$15K/month)
- You want to build in-house capability over time
- Long-term partnership (6-24+ months)
- You're post-PMF and need scaling strategy

## When to Hire a GTM Agency

An agency is right when:

- You lack internal execution team
- You need fast results
- You want hands-on campaign execution
- Higher budget available ($15K-$100K+)
- Specific project or campaign focus
- You need specialized expertise quickly
- You want to learn by observing professionals

## Cost Comparison

| Model | Monthly Cost | Hourly Rate | Commitment |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Fractional Manager | $3K-$15K | $150-$250/hr | 3-12 months |
| Agency (execution) | $15K-$50K | $150-$300/hr | 3-6 months |
| Agency (full-service) | $50K-$100K+ | $200-$500/hr | 6-12+ months |
| In-house hire | $10K-$20K | $50-$100/hr | Permanent |

## Hybrid Approach

Many companies combine both strategies for optimal results:

- **Fractional manager:** Sets strategy, manages overall direction
- **Agency:** Executes specific campaigns or channels
- **Internal team:** Handles day-to-day execution

This hybrid model gives you strategic leadership while also getting specialized execution support.

## Which Has Better ROI?

### Fractional Manager = Better Long-term ROI

- Lower ongoing cost
- Builds internal capability
- Creates strategic foundation
- Develops long-term partnership
- Knowledge stays in-house

### Agency = Better Short-term ROI

- Faster results and execution
- Immediate team capacity
- No need to onboard team
- Specialist expertise available now
- Proven playbooks and processes

## Recommendation

Hire a fractional manager if you want to build scaling strategy and have an internal team to manage. Hire an agency if you need fast execution and don't have internal resources.

**Best setup:** Fractional manager for strategy + agency for specialized execution. This combination gives you experienced leadership while ensuring campaigns get executed at scale.
