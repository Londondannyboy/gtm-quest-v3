## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do you measure ROI with long sales cycles?**
Prioritize leading indicators: engagement scores, stakeholder coverage, opportunity creation, pipeline influence, and account progression velocity over last-touch attribution.

**Strategic ABM vs Programmatic ABM?**
Strategic ABM with dedicated resources per account suits true enterprise (Fortune 500, Global 2000). Programmatic ABM suits "enterprise-lite" or high-volume mid-market segments.

**How important are analyst relations?**
Critical when Gartner, Forrester, or IDC research shapes buyer decisions. Leader or Strong Performer positioning significantly accelerates enterprise sales.

**How many accounts should we target?**
Strategic ABM typically focuses on 5-50 named accounts depending on sales capacity and resources. Quality prioritized over quantity.

**Should enterprise have separate branding?**
Unified brand typically works, but messaging should emphasize enterprise concerns: security, scale, support, integration, compliance versus mid-market ease-of-use focus.

## Conclusion
