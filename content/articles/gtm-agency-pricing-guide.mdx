## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much should I spend on a GTM agency?

Most B2B companies invest $10,000-50,000/month with agencies. Startups might start at $5,000-10,000/month; growth-stage companies often invest $25,000-75,000/month.

### Are GTM agencies worth the cost?

When well-matched, yes. Good agencies deliver ROI through faster growth, better execution, and expertise you'd struggle to hire internally. The key is choosing the right agency and setting clear expectations.

### Should I pay hourly or retainer?

Retainers are better for ongoing relationships—they align incentives and provide predictable budgeting. Hourly works for advisory or overflow work.

### What's included in a typical retainer?

Varies by agency, but typically: strategy, campaign management, content creation, reporting, and regular calls. Clarify: ad spend, design, development, and tools.

### Can I start small and scale up?

Yes. Many agencies offer pilot programs or starter packages. Prove value before expanding scope.

### How do I compare agency proposals?

Normalize scope—ensure you're comparing similar services. Look beyond price to team quality, methodology, and expected outcomes.

## Conclusion

GTM agency pricing ranges from $5,000/month for advisory work to $100,000+/month for comprehensive enterprise programs. The right investment depends on your goals, stage, and internal capabilities.

Focus on value rather than just cost. A more expensive agency that delivers results is better than a cheap one that doesn't. Start with clear objectives, evaluate proposals systematically, and build in room to adjust as you learn what works.
