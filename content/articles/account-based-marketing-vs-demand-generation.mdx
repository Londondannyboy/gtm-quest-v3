# Account-Based Marketing vs Demand Generation

Account-based marketing (ABM) focuses on highly personalized campaigns targeting specific high-value accounts, while demand generation takes a broad awareness approach to create pipeline at scale across your entire target market.

## Quick Overview

### Account-Based Marketing (ABM)

- **Approach:** Highly targeted
- **Focus:** Specific high-value accounts
- **Strategy:** Personalized campaigns per account
- **Team:** Marketing + sales working together
- **Timeline:** Longer, relationship-focused
- **Best for:** Enterprise B2B

### Demand Generation

- **Approach:** Broad awareness
- **Focus:** Entire target market
- **Strategy:** Create awareness at scale
- **Team:** Marketing-led
- **Timeline:** Create pipeline broadly
- **Best for:** SaaS growth

## Key Differences

| Factor | ABM | Demand Generation |
|--------|-----|-------------------|
| Scope | 10-100 accounts | 1000+ accounts |
| Personalization | Highly personalized | Standard messaging |
| Sales involvement | High | Low-Medium |
| Timeline | 6-12+ months | 3-6 months |
| Cost | High (EUR 50K-500K/month) | Medium (EUR 10K-100K/month) |
| Goal | Close large deals | Generate pipeline |

## When to Use ABM

ABM is the right choice when you have:

- Enterprise B2B sales motion
- High contract values (EUR 500K+)
- Complex sales cycles with multiple stakeholders
- Few target accounts to pursue
- Well-aligned sales team ready to collaborate

## When to Use Demand Generation

Demand generation works best when you have:

- SaaS growth objectives
- Lower contract values
- Faster sales cycles
- Large target market to address
- High volume pipeline goals

## Hybrid Approach

Best-in-class B2B companies leverage both strategies together:

1. **Broad demand generation** to fill top of funnel with awareness
2. **ABM for high-value accounts** that warrant personalized attention
3. **Sales team focus** on pipeline conversion across both motions

This combined approach ensures you're building brand awareness broadly while also pursuing your most valuable opportunities with precision.

## Conclusion

Demand generation drives broad pipeline growth, while ABM closes high-value deals. Use both for comprehensive revenue growth. The key is matching the right strategy to your deal size, sales cycle complexity, and available resources.
