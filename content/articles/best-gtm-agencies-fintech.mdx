## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why do FinTech agencies cost more than general B2B agencies?**
Specialized compliance expertise, financial institution relationships, and regulatory understanding command premium pricing. The cost of compliance mistakes or missed credibility signals far exceeds agency premiums.

**How long until I see pipeline from FinTech marketing?**
Expect 6-12 months to establish thought leadership and initial pipeline. Enterprise financial institution deals take 12-24+ months to close. Plan accordingly with patient capital and realistic expectations.

**Should I prioritize banks or FinTech companies as customers?**
Both require different approaches. Banks demand extensive compliance, security, and credibility; FinTech-to-FinTech sales move faster but may have smaller deal sizes. Agencies should understand your specific target market dynamics.

**How do I market crypto and blockchain products?**
Crypto marketing requires specialized expertise in regulatory gray areas, community building, and credibility with both retail and institutional audiences. Select agencies with proven crypto portfolios and regulatory communication experience.

**What role do industry events play in FinTech GTM?**
Events like Money20/20, Sibos, and Finovate are essential for relationship building, credibility, and pipeline generation. Budget for meaningful event presence (speaking, sponsorship, meetings) rather than just attendance.

## Conclusion

FinTech companies require agency partners who understand regulatory complexity, can build credibility with conservative buyers, and have patience for extended sales cycles. Success comes from selecting agencies with deep financial services expertise, established industry relationships, and appreciation for the trust-based nature of financial technology sales. Avoid agencies that promise quick wins incompatible with financial services buying dynamics.
