## Frequently Asked Questions

**Should I use an agency or hire in-house?**
Agencies provide faster time-to-market and specialized expertise. In-house builds institutional knowledge but takes longer to recruit and ramp. Many companies start with agencies, then transition to hybrid models.

**How long does European expansion take?**
Expect 6-12 months for meaningful market presence in 2-3 initial markets. Full European coverage typically requires 18-24 months of sustained effort.

**Can Irish agencies support German and French markets?**
Yes, through partnerships or multilingual team members. Verify specific language and cultural capabilities for your priority markets during evaluation.

**What's typically included in retainer pricing?**
Strategy, campaign management, content creation, reporting, and optimization. Media spend, technology subscriptions, and specialized production often billed separately.

**How do you measure agency ROI?**
Focus on pipeline generation, revenue attribution, CAC efficiency, and sales cycle velocity by market. Establish clear attribution models and reporting cadence during onboarding.

## Conclusion

Irish agencies enable European growth for B2B technology companies through English-language operations, European market access, multilingual talent, and transatlantic connectivity. Success requires selecting partners with proven experience, clear metrics, and cultural fit. The recommended approach: focused entry in 2-3 markets, validation of product-market fit, then systematic scaling across the region. Ireland's unique position as a bridge between North American and European markets makes it an excellent base for EMEA expansion strategies.
