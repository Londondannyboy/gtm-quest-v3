## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why choose a NYC agency over a remote alternative?**
NYC agencies offer in-person strategic collaboration, enterprise buyer proximity, and media relationship access. For enterprise-focused companies, these advantages often outweigh cost premiums.

**How do I evaluate senior team involvement?**
Ask specifically who will attend strategy sessions and lead campaigns. Request direct access to senior strategists, not just account managers. Check references on actual team engagement.

**What industries are NYC agencies strongest in?**
Financial services, enterprise technology, media, and professional services dominate NYC agency expertise. Healthcare and industrial companies may find stronger specialists elsewhere.

**Should I work with multiple specialized agencies or one full-service partner?**
Full-service agencies provide integration and efficiency; specialists offer depth. Many companies use a lead agency for strategy and integration with specialists for specific channels.

**How important are in-person meetings?**
Quarterly strategic sessions and annual planning benefit significantly from in-person collaboration. Day-to-day execution works well remotely with established relationships.

New York City agencies offer enterprise expertise, financial services specialization, and strategic sophistication unmatched in other markets. Success comes from selecting partners with relevant vertical experience, demonstrated senior team engagement, and cultural alignment with your brand.
