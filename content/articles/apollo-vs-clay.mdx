## Key Differences

| Aspect | Apollo | Clay |
|--------|--------|------|
| Data Source | Proprietary database | Aggregates 50+ providers |
| Use Case | End-to-end prospecting | Data enrichment & workflows |
| Complexity | Low - easy to use | High - requires setup |
| Sales Engagement | Built-in sequences, dialer | None - export to other tools |
| Best For | Sales teams wanting simplicity | RevOps teams with complex needs |

### Data Philosophy

**Apollo** maintains a proprietary database built through web scraping and user contributions. Unified approach provides consistency but may have coverage gaps.

**Clay** aggregates multiple third-party sources, allowing waterfall checking across 5-10 sources for single data points. Higher coverage but requires more setup.

### Technical Complexity

**Apollo** offers straightforward UX - reps can prospect within hours of onboarding.

**Clay** requires technical sophistication and understanding of data sources and automation concepts.

## When to Choose Apollo

1. Your team needs all-in-one simplicity
2. Budget is constrained
3. You prioritize speed to value
4. Standard B2B outbound workflows are sufficient
5. Limited RevOps resources

## When to Choose Clay

1. You need maximum data coverage and accuracy
2. Complex data requirements with custom scoring
3. You already use dedicated sales engagement tools
4. You have RevOps resources
5. You need reverse email lookup at scale

## Using Both Together

Many sophisticated teams use both:

- **Clay for enrichment, Apollo for engagement** - Enrich in Clay, execute sequences in Apollo
- **Apollo for quick wins, Clay for strategic** - Apollo for mid-market, Clay for enterprise
- **Clay as data layer above Apollo** - Access Apollo's API through Clay alongside other sources

## Conclusion

Apollo excels as an accessible, all-in-one platform for teams wanting prospecting and engagement without technical complexity. Clay provides superior data operations for teams with RevOps resources and sophisticated requirements.

For most teams under 20 reps, Apollo offers better value. For teams with complex data needs or existing engagement tools, Clay provides capabilities that justify the additional complexity.
