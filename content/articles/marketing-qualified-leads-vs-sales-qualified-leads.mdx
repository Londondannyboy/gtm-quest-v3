# MQL vs SQL: Complete Guide to Lead Qualification

## Quick Overview

Understanding the distinction between Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) and Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs) is fundamental to B2B revenue efficiency. These stages drive alignment between marketing and sales while optimizing resource allocation.

### Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)

**Definition:** Prospects engaged with marketing efforts who show interest but lack sales vetting

- Demonstrated interest through content engagement
- Met basic firmographic criteria
- Not yet validated for buying intent
- Owned and nurtured by marketing
- Ready for additional qualification

### Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)

**Definition:** Vetted prospects demonstrating genuine purchase intent and fit

- Confirmed buying intent
- Fits ideal customer profile (ICP)
- Has budget, authority, need, and timeline (BANT)
- Ready for active sales engagement
- Owned by sales team

## The Critical Difference

| Aspect | MQL | SQL |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Signal | Interest | Intent |
| Behavior | Passive engagement | Active buying signals |
| Validation | Marketing criteria | Sales qualification |
| Owner | Marketing | Sales |
| Action | Nurture | Sell |

**MQLs demonstrate INTEREST** through passive engagement behaviors like downloading content, attending webinars, or visiting pricing pages.

**SQLs demonstrate INTENT** through active behaviors like requesting demonstrations, asking about pricing, or discussing specific problems they need solved.

## MQL Qualification Criteria

### Behavioral Signals

- Downloaded gated content (eBooks, whitepapers)
- Attended webinar or virtual event
- Visited high-intent pages (pricing, demo request)
- Engaged with multiple emails
- Returned to site multiple times
- Spent significant time on product pages

### Firmographic Criteria

- Company size within target range
- Industry in target verticals
- Geography in serviceable markets
- Technology stack alignment
- Revenue within ideal range

### Lead Scoring Example

| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Downloaded eBook | +10 |
| Attended webinar | +15 |
| Visited pricing page | +20 |
| Requested demo | +50 |
| Target company size | +10 |
| Target industry | +10 |
| **MQL Threshold** | **50 points** |

## SQL Qualification Criteria

### BANT Framework

**Budget**
- Confirmed budget exists
- Budget range identified
- Fiscal year timing known
- Approval process understood

**Authority**
- Decision-maker identified
- Buying committee mapped
- Champion established
- Influencers known

**Need**
- Problem clearly articulated
- Impact of problem quantified
- Current solution gaps identified
- Success criteria defined

**Timeline**
- Implementation deadline exists
- Evaluation timeline confirmed
- Decision date targeted
- Urgency level assessed

### SQL Qualification Questions

1. "What budget have you allocated for this initiative?"
2. "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
3. "What's driving the urgency to solve this now?"
4. "When do you need to have a solution in place?"
5. "What happens if you don't address this problem?"

## Conversion Benchmarks

### Healthy B2B SaaS Funnel

| Stage | Conversion Rate |
|-------|-----------------|
| Visitor to Lead | 1-3% |
| Lead to MQL | 15-25% |
| **MQL to SQL** | **20-30%** |
| SQL to Opportunity | 40-70% |
| Opportunity to Close | 15-30% |
| **Lead to Customer** | **0.5-0.8%** |

### MQL to SQL Conversion Analysis

| Conversion Rate | Diagnosis |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Below 15% | Quality or follow-up issues |
| 15-20% | Room for improvement |
| 20-30% | Healthy performance |
| 30-35% | Strong alignment |
| Above 35% | May be too restrictive |

**Below 15% indicates:**
- Lead scoring is too loose
- MQL criteria need tightening
- Sales follow-up is inadequate
- ICP definition is off

**Above 35% may indicate:**
- MQL criteria are too strict
- Missing potential opportunities
- Marketing being too conservative
- Limiting pipeline volume
