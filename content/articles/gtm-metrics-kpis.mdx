- **Target:** $0.50-$5 depending on industry

#### Cost Per Lead (CPL)

- Total marketing expenditure divided by leads generated
- **Target:** $50-$500 depending on industry

### Sales Metrics

#### LTV:CAC Ratio

Lifetime value divided by acquisition cost.

**Target:** 3:1 or higher demonstrates sustainability

#### Customer Acquisition Payback Period

Time to recover acquisition investment.

```
Payback Period = CAC / (Monthly Revenue per Customer x Gross Margin)
```

**Target:** 12 months or less

### Efficiency Metrics
