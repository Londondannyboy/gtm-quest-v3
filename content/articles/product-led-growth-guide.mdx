# The Complete Guide to Product-Led Growth

Product-led growth (PLG) is a go-to-market strategy that relies on the product itself as the primary driver of customer acquisition, conversion, and expansion.

## What is Product-Led Growth?

PLG companies like Slack, Dropbox, and Zoom have shown that when your product delivers immediate value, users become your best salespeople.

### Key Characteristics of PLG

1. **Free Trial or Freemium Model** - Users can experience value before paying
2. **Self-Serve Onboarding** - No sales call required to get started
3. **In-Product Upsells** - Natural upgrade paths within the product
4. **Viral Mechanics** - Built-in sharing and collaboration features

## PLG vs Sales-Led Growth

| Aspect | PLG | Sales-Led |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| First Touch | Product | Sales Rep |
| Time to Value | Minutes | Weeks |
| Customer Acquisition Cost | Low | High |
| Scalability | High | Limited |

## Building Your PLG Motion

### Step 1: Identify Your "Aha Moment"

What's the moment when users realize your product's value? For Slack, it's when a team sends 2,000 messages. For Dropbox, it's the first file sync.

### Step 2: Remove Friction

Every step between signup and value realization is friction. Audit your onboarding and eliminate unnecessary steps.

### Step 3: Measure Everything

Track activation metrics, time to value, and product-qualified leads (PQLs). Use tools like Mixpanel, Amplitude, or Heap.

## Common PLG Metrics

- **Time to Value (TTV)** - How long until users experience value?
- **Activation Rate** - What percentage complete key actions?
- **Free to Paid Conversion** - How many free users upgrade?
- **Net Revenue Retention** - Are customers expanding?

## Is PLG Right for You?

PLG works best when:
- Your product solves a clear, immediate pain
- Users can experience value without configuration
- You're targeting SMB or prosumer markets
- Viral or collaborative features are natural fits
