## Frequently Asked Questions

**Should I choose Sydney over US agencies?**
Sydney provides critical APAC expertise, timezone coverage, and local networks. For regional strategies, Sydney agencies offer superior market knowledge compared to US alternatives.

**How does the Australian market differ from the US?**
Expect more concentrated enterprise bases, longer relationship cycles, strong LinkedIn effectiveness, and 20-30% longer sales cycles compared to US markets.

**Can Sydney agencies support Asian expansion?**
Top agencies have APAC partnerships, but verify specific language and cultural capabilities for priority markets like Singapore, Japan, or Korea.

**What ROI timeline should I expect?**
Expect 3-4 months for initial pipeline, 6 months for revenue impact, and 9-12 months for full optimization.

**Do I need internal GTM leadership?**
Pre-$5M ARR companies can use agencies as fractional GTM leadership. Scale to full VP GTM/CMO roles with continued agency support as you grow.

## Conclusion

Success requires selecting partners with proven APAC experience, Australian market understanding, and performance accountability. The recommended approach: validate strategy in Australia first, then scale regionally using systematic, repeatable revenue engine principles. Evaluate agencies based on regional track records, vertical expertise, and demonstrated scaling capabilities.
