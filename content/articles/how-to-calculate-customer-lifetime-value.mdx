# How to Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): Formula & Guide

Customer Lifetime Value represents the total revenue a customer generates over their entire relationship with your company. Understanding LTV is essential for making informed decisions about acquisition spending, customer success investments, and overall business strategy.

## Why LTV Matters

LTV helps you answer critical business questions:

- **How much can you spend to acquire a customer?** Your LTV sets the ceiling for acquisition costs.
- **Which customer segments are most valuable?** LTV analysis reveals where to focus resources.
- **Is your business sustainable?** Healthy LTV metrics indicate long-term viability.
- **How should you prioritize retention vs. acquisition?** LTV calculations inform resource allocation.

## LTV Formulas

### Basic Formula

For straightforward calculations:

```
LTV = Average Customer Revenue per Year x Average Customer Lifespan
```

### Advanced Formula

For more accurate SaaS and subscription businesses:

```
LTV = (Annual Revenue Per Customer x Gross Margin %) / Monthly Churn Rate
```

### Example Calculation

Consider a SaaS company with:
- Annual Revenue Per Customer: $12,000
- Gross Margin: 70%
- Monthly Churn Rate: 5%

```
LTV = ($12,000 x 0.70) / 0.05 = $168,000
```

## Four-Step Calculation Process

### Step 1: Calculate ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)

Divide total revenue by customer count to get your baseline revenue metric.

```
ARPU = Total Revenue / Number of Customers
```

### Step 2: Determine Gross Margin

Calculate the percentage of revenue remaining after direct costs.

```
Gross Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue
```

### Step 3: Measure Churn Rate

Track customers lost divided by starting customers over a period.

```
Monthly Churn = Customers Lost This Month / Customers at Start of Month
```

### Step 4: Apply the LTV Formula

Combine these metrics using the advanced formula for your final LTV calculation.

## LTV by Business Model

### SaaS Companies

Focus on:
- Monthly/annual subscription rates
- Expansion revenue from upsells
- Churn and retention patterns

### E-commerce Businesses

Emphasize:
- Purchase frequency
- Average order value
- Customer lifespan across purchases

### Marketplace Models

Consider:
- Transaction volume
- Commission rates
- Buyer and seller retention

## Key Financial Metrics

### LTV:CAC Ratio

This ratio indicates business health by comparing customer value to acquisition cost.

```
LTV:CAC Ratio = Customer Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost
```

**Benchmarks:**
- Below 1:1 - Unsustainable, losing money on each customer
- 1:1 to 3:1 - Needs improvement
- 3:1 or higher - Healthy, sustainable business
- Above 5:1 - May be under-investing in growth

### Payback Period

Measures how quickly you recover customer acquisition costs.

```
Payback Period = CAC / (Monthly Revenue per Customer x Gross Margin)
```

**Target:** 12 months or less for most SaaS businesses.
