# Product-Led Growth vs Sales-Led GTM

Two fundamental go-to-market approaches for software companies, each with distinct advantages depending on your product, market, and business model.

## What's the Difference?

### Product-Led Growth (PLG)

PLG relies on the product itself to drive acquisition and conversion:

- Users discover and adopt product through the product itself
- Free trials and freemium business models
- Self-serve onboarding capabilities
- Lower customer acquisition expenses
- Bottom-up adoption (users influence purchase)

**Examples:** Slack, Dropbox, Zoom, Figma, Notion

### Sales-Led GTM

Sales-driven approaches rely on human relationships:

- Sales team drives adoption and purchasing
- Direct outreach, product demonstrations, and contract negotiations
- Higher customer acquisition costs
- Top-down purchase decisions
- Relationship-driven sales process

**Examples:** Salesforce, Oracle, Workday, SAP

## When to Use Product-Led Growth

PLG works best for:

- Low-cost software solutions (under $500/month)
- Self-service products with clear value
- Strong product differentiation
- B2B SaaS with product-driven value propositions
- Target audiences that self-educate
- Viral or network effects built into the product

## When to Use Sales-Led GTM

Sales-led strategies work best for:

- Enterprise software platforms
- Complex implementation requirements
- High contract values ($50k+ ACV)
- Multiple stakeholders in purchasing decisions
- Long sales cycles (3+ months)
- Customization-intensive solutions
- Regulated industries requiring compliance

## The Hybrid Approach

Many successful companies use both approaches:

| Motion | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| Self-serve freemium | Awareness generation and SMB |
| Sales team | Enterprise and strategic accounts |
| Outbound sales | Expansion opportunities |

### How to Implement Hybrid

1. **Start with PLG** - Build self-serve motion first
2. **Add Sales for Enterprise** - Layer in sales for larger deals
3. **Use Product Signals** - Sales focuses on product-qualified leads
4. **Separate Motions** - Different teams for each motion

## Key Metrics by Approach

### PLG Metrics

- Product-qualified leads (PQLs)
- Free-to-paid conversion rate
- Time to value
- Product adoption scores
- Net revenue retention

### Sales-Led Metrics

- Sales-qualified leads (SQLs)
- Win rates
- Average deal size
- Sales cycle length
- Quota attainment

## Conclusion

Product-led growth is ideal for self-service tools with clear value, while sales-led GTM works better for enterprise and complex solutions. Many successful companies combine both approaches, using PLG for awareness and SMB while sales handles enterprise accounts.
