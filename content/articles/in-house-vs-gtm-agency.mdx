# In-House Team vs GTM Agency: Which is Right for You?

One of the biggest strategic decisions for B2B companies is whether to build an internal go-to-market team or partner with a GTM agency. Both approaches have merit, and the right choice depends on your company's stage, resources, and growth objectives.

## Quick Comparison

| Factor | In-House Team | GTM Agency |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Time to Impact** | 3-6 months to hire and ramp | 2-4 weeks to onboard |
| **Annual Cost** | $300K-800K+ (small team) | $180K-600K (retainer) |
| **Control** | Full control | Collaborative |
| **Expertise Breadth** | Limited by team size | Access to specialists |
| **Scalability** | Slow (hiring cycles) | Fast (flex resources) |
| **Institutional Knowledge** | Retained internally | Shared with agency |

## The In-House Approach

### What It Looks Like

A typical early-stage in-house GTM team might include:

- **VP/Head of Marketing**: $180K-280K
- **Demand Gen Manager**: $90K-140K
- **Content Marketer**: $70K-110K
- **Marketing Ops/RevOps**: $80K-130K

Total: $420K-660K in salary alone, plus benefits (add 25-35%), tools, and overhead.

### Advantages of In-House

- Understands product nuances intimately
- Can respond quickly to market changes

**2. Full-Time Dedication**

- Available for ad-hoc needs
- Integrated with other departments

**3. Cultural Alignment**
- Part of the company culture
- Invested in long-term success
- Direct accountability to leadership

**4. Asset Building**

### Challenges of In-House

- Risk of bad hires (costly to correct)

**2. Limited Expertise**

## Decision Framework

### Choose In-House When:

- **Long-term view**: Building for 3+ year horizon
- **Stable needs**: Predictable, consistent workload
- **Strong leadership**: Have CMO/VP to manage team
- **Cultural importance**: Marketing as core competency
- **Retention focus**: Want to keep knowledge internal
- **Budget allows**: Can afford full team + overhead

### Choose GTM Agency When:

- **Speed matters**: Need results in weeks, not months
- **Variable needs**: Workload fluctuates significantly
- **Expertise gaps**: Need specialists you can't hire
- **Transitional period**: Between hires or pivoting
- **Cost flexibility**: Want variable vs fixed costs
- **External perspective**: Need fresh strategic input

### Hybrid Approach

Many companies use both:

**Internal**: Strategic leadership, brand ownership, key relationships
**Agency**: Execution, specialist channels, overflow capacity

Example structure:
- In-house: VP Marketing + Marketing Ops
- Agency: Demand gen execution, content production, paid media

## Transition Considerations

### Moving from Agency to In-House

Plan for:
- Knowledge transfer period (3-6 months overlap)
- Documentation of processes and playbooks
- Handoff of vendor relationships
- Training on tools and systems

### Moving from In-House to Agency

Consider:
- What internal resources to retain
- How to transfer institutional knowledge
- Maintaining relationships with stakeholders
- Clear scope and expectations

## Questions to Ask Yourself

1. **Timeline**: How quickly do you need results?
2. **Budget**: What's your total marketing budget?
3. **Leadership**: Do you have strong marketing leadership?
4. **Stability**: Are your needs consistent or variable?
5. **Expertise**: What skills do you need most?
6. **Culture**: How important is building internal capability?
7. **Risk tolerance**: Can you afford hiring mistakes?

## Conclusion

There's no universally "right" answer. Early-stage companies often benefit from agency partnerships that provide instant expertise and flexibility. As companies scale and needs stabilize, building internal teams often makes more sense.

The best approach is often hybrid: maintain strategic leadership and critical functions in-house while leveraging agencies for execution, specialist skills, and capacity flexibility.
