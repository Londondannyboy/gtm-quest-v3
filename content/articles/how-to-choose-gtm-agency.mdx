# How to Choose a GTM Agency

Selecting the right [GTM agency](/) can accelerate your growth significantly—but choosing the wrong one wastes budget and time. This guide walks you through a systematic approach to finding and evaluating go-to-market agency partners.

## Before You Start: Define Your Needs

Before evaluating agencies, get clarity on what you actually need.

### Questions to Answer First

1. **What problem are you solving?**
   - Launching a new product?
   - Entering new markets?
   - Scaling existing efforts?
   - Fixing underperformance?

2. **What's your current state?**
   - Do you have product-market fit?
   - What's working today?
   - What's not working?
   - What have you already tried?

3. **What resources do you have?**
   - Budget range (monthly/annual)
   - Internal team capabilities
   - Executive sponsorship
   - Timeline expectations

4. **What does success look like?**
   - Pipeline targets
   - Revenue goals
   - Efficiency metrics (CAC, LTV)
   - Qualitative outcomes

### Common GTM Agency Use Cases

| Situation | What You Need |
|-----------|---------------|
| Pre-launch | Strategy, positioning, launch planning |
| Post-launch stall | Demand gen, optimization, new channels |
| Scale-up | Execution capacity, process, automation |
| Enterprise expansion | ABM, sales enablement, complex sales |
| Turnaround | Audit, strategy reset, new approach |

## Step 1: Create Your Shortlist

### Where to Find GTM Agencies

1. **Agency directories** - [GTM Quest](/) lists 200+ vetted agencies
2. **Referrals** - Ask peers, investors, advisors
3. **Content creators** - Agencies with strong thought leadership
4. **Technology partners** - HubSpot, Salesforce partner directories
5. **Industry events** - Conference sponsors and speakers

### Initial Filtering Criteria

Narrow your list based on:

- **Specialization match** - Do they focus on your needs?
- **Industry experience** - Have they worked in your space?
- **Company size fit** - Do they serve companies your size?
- **Geographic relevance** - If location matters for your market
- **Budget alignment** - Are they in your price range?

Aim for a shortlist of 4-6 agencies for deeper evaluation.

## Step 2: Evaluate Agency Fit

### The 7 Critical Evaluation Criteria

#### 1. Industry and Market Expertise

**Why it matters:** Agencies with relevant experience ramp faster and avoid common mistakes.

**What to look for:**
- Client logos in your industry
- Content about your market
- Understanding of your buyer journey
- Familiarity with industry tools and channels

**Questions to ask:**
- "What similar companies have you worked with?"
- "What's unique about marketing in our industry?"
- "What mistakes do you see companies like ours make?"

#### 2. Stage and Scale Fit

**Why it matters:** What works for Series A is different from what works for growth stage.

**What to look for:**
- Experience with companies at your stage
- Appropriate engagement models
- Realistic expectations for your situation
- Scalable vs scrappy approaches as needed

**Questions to ask:**
- "What stage companies do you typically work with?"
- "How would your approach differ for a company at our stage?"
- "What results have you achieved for similar-stage companies?"

#### 3. Service Capability Match

**Why it matters:** You need an agency that can deliver what you actually need.

| Your Need | Agency Capability to Evaluate |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Strategy | Strategic frameworks, workshops |
| Demand gen | Content, paid, email, events |
| ABM | Account-based programs, personalization |
| Sales enablement | Collateral, training, process |
| RevOps | Technology, data, automation |

**Questions to ask:**
- "Walk me through how you'd approach [specific need]"
- "What would the first 90 days look like?"
- "Who on your team would do this work?"

#### 4. Team Quality and Structure

**Why it matters:** You're buying people, not just a brand name.

**What to look for:**
- Who leads strategy vs execution
- Seniority of people on your account
- Team stability and tenure
- Specialist access when needed

**Questions to ask:**
- "Who would be my day-to-day contact?"
- "Who does the actual work—your team or contractors?"
- "How do you handle specialized needs (design, dev, etc.)?"
- "What's your team's average tenure?"

#### 5. Process and Methodology

**Why it matters:** Proven processes deliver more consistent results.

**What to look for:**
- Documented methodology
- Clear onboarding process
- Regular reporting and communication
- Defined milestones and deliverables

**Questions to ask:**
- "What's your process for the first 30/60/90 days?"
- "How do you communicate progress and results?"
- "What does your reporting look like?"
- "How do you handle strategy pivots?"

#### 6. Results and Case Studies

**Why it matters:** Past performance indicates future results.

**What to look for:**
- Specific, measurable outcomes
- Results relevant to your situation
- Client testimonials and references
- Transparent about what worked and didn't

**Questions to ask:**
- "Can you share a case study similar to our situation?"
- "What metrics did you move and by how much?"
- "What didn't work and how did you adjust?"
- "Can I speak with a current or recent client?"

#### 7. Cultural and Working Style Fit

**Why it matters:** You'll work closely together—fit matters.

**What to look for:**
- Communication style alignment
- Responsiveness during sales process
- Transparency and honesty
- Collaborative vs prescriptive approach

**Questions to ask:**
- "How do you handle disagreements with clients?"
- "What makes a client relationship successful?"
- "What type of client do you work best with?"
- "What would make you fire a client?"

## Step 3: Run a Structured Evaluation

### Discovery Call (30-60 min)

**Purpose:** Initial fit assessment

**Agenda:**
1. Your situation and needs (10 min)
2. Agency overview and approach (15 min)
3. Relevant experience discussion (15 min)
4. Logistics (pricing, timeline, next steps) (10 min)

**Red flags:**
- They don't ask questions about your business
- Generic pitch not tailored to your situation
- Overselling or unrealistic promises
- Can't articulate their methodology

### Proposal Review

**What a good proposal includes:**
- Understanding of your situation
- Recommended approach and rationale
- Specific scope and deliverables
- Team and roles
- Timeline and milestones
- Pricing and terms
- Success metrics

**Red flags:**
- Cookie-cutter proposal
- Vague deliverables
- No success metrics defined
- Pricing without clear scope

### Reference Checks

**Questions for references:**
- "What was the agency best at?"
- "What could they improve?"
- "Would you hire them again?"
- "What results did you achieve?"
- "How did they handle challenges?"

## Step 4: Negotiate and Structure

### Engagement Models

| Model | Best For | Typical Terms |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Monthly retainer | Ongoing work | 6-12 month commitment |
| Project-based | Defined deliverables | Fixed scope and price |
| Fractional | Leadership + some execution | Monthly, flexible |
| Performance | Results-based | Base + success fees |

### Contract Considerations

- **Term length** - Shorter is better initially (3-6 months)
- **Termination clause** - 30-day notice is reasonable
- **Scope flexibility** - Ability to adjust as you learn
- **IP ownership** - You should own deliverables
- **Confidentiality** - Standard NDA protections

### Pricing Negotiation

- Ask about startup/growth discounts
- Consider longer terms for better rates
- Negotiate scope, not just price
- Understand what's included vs extra
- Clarify payment terms

## Red Flags to Avoid

### During Sales Process

- **Guaranteed results** - Nobody can guarantee outcomes
- **No discovery** - They pitch without understanding you
- **Bait and switch** - Senior people sell, juniors deliver
- **Pressure tactics** - Urgency without reason
- **No references** - Can't or won't provide them

### In Proposals

- **Vague scope** - "Strategic support" without specifics
- **No metrics** - Can't define success
- **All execution, no strategy** - Just doing stuff
- **Excessive jargon** - Hiding behind buzzwords
- **One-size-fits-all** - Same proposal for everyone

### In Contracts

- **Long lock-ins** - 12+ months with no exit
- **Hidden fees** - Unclear what's included
- **Vague deliverables** - Can't measure fulfillment
- **No termination clause** - Can't get out if it's not working

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many agencies should I evaluate?

4-6 agencies is ideal. Fewer limits options; more creates evaluation fatigue.

### Should I do a paid pilot first?

If offered, a paid pilot (1-3 months) can reduce risk. Just ensure scope is meaningful enough to evaluate performance.

### What if I'm choosing between specialists and generalists?

Specialists for specific needs (ABM, content, paid). Generalists for comprehensive support. Consider specialists if you have strong internal strategy.

### How important is geographic location?

Less than it used to be. Most agencies work remotely effectively. Consider time zones for real-time collaboration needs.

### Should price be the deciding factor?

No. Value matters more than cost. A more expensive agency that delivers results is better than a cheap one that doesn't.

## Conclusion

Choosing a [GTM agency](/) is a significant decision that can accelerate or hinder your growth. Take time to define your needs, evaluate options systematically, and trust both data and intuition.

The best agency relationships are partnerships—find a team that you trust, that understands your business, and that's genuinely invested in your success.
