- Marketing automation (HubSpot Marketing)
- Complete revenue visibility

**Drawbacks:**
- Higher total cost
- Two systems to manage

**When it makes sense:**
- Large sales teams (50+ reps)
- Complex sales processes
- High-volume outbound motion
- Enterprise deals with long cycles

## Migration Considerations

### Moving from Salesloft to HubSpot

**What transfers:**
- Contact data
- Activity history
- Deal information
- Templates (manual recreation)

**What doesn't transfer:**
- Cadence performance data
- Conversation recordings
- Automation workflows

**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks typical

### Moving from HubSpot to Salesloft

This is less common since you'd still need a CRM. More typical is adding Salesloft alongside HubSpot.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use HubSpot sequences instead of Salesloft?

Yes, HubSpot Sales Hub includes sequences. They're adequate for many teams but less sophisticated than Salesloft's cadences for high-volume outbound.

### Does Salesloft replace HubSpot?

No. Salesloft is a sales engagement tool, not a CRM or marketing platform. You need HubSpot, Salesforce, or another CRM alongside Salesloft.

### Which is better for small teams?

HubSpot. The free CRM and lower-cost tiers make it accessible, and you get marketing tools included.

### Which is better for large sales teams?

Salesloft, especially if you already have Salesforce. The advanced cadence and coaching features are designed for scale.

### Can I integrate HubSpot and Salesloft?

Yes. There's a native integration that syncs contacts, activities, and deals between platforms.

### Which has better reporting?

HubSpot has broader reporting across marketing and sales. Salesloft has deeper sales-specific analytics and coaching insights.

### Is Salesloft worth the extra cost?

If you're running high-volume outbound with 10+ SDRs/AEs and need advanced cadence automation, conversation intelligence, and coaching—yes. For smaller teams or inbound-focused motions, probably not.

## Conclusion

**Choose HubSpot if:**
- You want an all-in-one platform
- Marketing automation is important
- You're cost-conscious
- You have a smaller team (under 20 sales reps)
- Inbound is your primary motion

**Choose Salesloft if:**
- You need best-in-class sales engagement
- You already have Salesforce
- High-volume outbound is your model
- Conversation intelligence matters
- You have budget for specialized tools

**Choose both if:**
- You're a larger organization (50+ reps)
- You want marketing automation AND advanced sales engagement
- Budget allows for best-of-breed approach
- You have ops resources to manage integration

For most B2B companies starting out, HubSpot provides the best value. As you scale and outbound becomes more sophisticated, adding Salesloft makes sense.
