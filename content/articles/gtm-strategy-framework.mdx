## GTM Strategy by Company Stage

|-------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Direct customer dialogue | Founder-led outbound | Problem-solution testing | Discovering repeatable acquisition |

### Growth Stage (Post-Product Market Fit)

| Focus | Distribution | Communication | Objective |

## Key GTM Decisions

1. **Pricing approach:** Freemium models, trial periods, or premium sales structures
2. **Sales methodology:** Product-led growth, sales-driven, or hybrid approaches
3. **Market entry motion:** Direct outreach, inbound attraction, events, partnerships
4. **Sales organization:** AEs with BDRs, hybrid teams, or fully-loaded structures
5. **Year-one focus:** Single ICP versus multiple market segments

## Common GTM Mistakes

- Unclear or inconsistent value messaging
- Sales and marketing misalignment
- Premature product launch without adequate preparation
- Insufficient competitive analysis
- Resistance to customer feedback integration
- Premature sales organization expansion
