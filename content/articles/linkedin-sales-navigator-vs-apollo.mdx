## Quick Overview

LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Apollo.io represent two distinct approaches to B2B prospecting. Sales Navigator leverages LinkedIn's professional network for relationship-driven selling, while Apollo provides an all-in-one prospecting and engagement platform.

### LinkedIn Sales Navigator

- Access to LinkedIn's live database of 900M+ professional profiles
- Unique relationship mapping through TeamLink and connection degrees
- Native LinkedIn engagement (InMail, messages, connection requests)
- Real-time profile updates
- Price: $99-$149/user/month

### Apollo.io

**Best For:** High-volume email campaigns and multi-channel prospecting

- Proprietary database of 275M+ contacts with emails and phone numbers

## Key Platform Differences

### Data Access & Contact Information

| Email Addresses | Not included | Included |
| Phone Numbers | Not included | Included |
| Data Source | User-maintained LinkedIn | Aggregated/scraped |

**Sales Navigator** provides access to LinkedIn's live, user-maintained database—but notably excludes direct contact information like email addresses and phone numbers.

**Apollo** maintains a proprietary database with email addresses and phone numbers sourced through multiple methods, enabling direct outreach.

### Primary Engagement Channels

A critical differentiator: Sales Navigator offers **unique relationship mapping** through TeamLink and connection degrees, showing organizational connections to prospects.

- See who in your company is connected to a prospect

- Track job changes and company news

Apollo provides standard contact data without this relationship pathway visibility.
