- Access to LinkedIn's live database of 900M+ professional profiles
- Unique relationship mapping through TeamLink and connection degrees
- Native LinkedIn engagement (InMail, messages, connection requests)
- Real-time profile updates
- Price: $99-$149/user/month

### Apollo.io

## Key Platform Differences

### Data Access & Contact Information

| Aspect | Sales Navigator | Apollo |
|--------|-----------------|--------|

| Email Addresses | Not included | Included |
| Phone Numbers | Not included | Included |
| Data Source | User-maintained LinkedIn | Aggregated/scraped |
| Data Freshness | Real-time | Varies |

**Sales Navigator** provides access to LinkedIn's live, user-maintained database—but notably excludes direct contact information like email addresses and phone numbers.

**Apollo** maintains a proprietary database with email addresses and phone numbers sourced through multiple methods, enabling direct outreach.

### Primary Engagement Channels

### Relationship Intelligence

A critical differentiator: Sales Navigator offers **unique relationship mapping** through TeamLink and connection degrees, showing organizational connections to prospects.

- See who in your company is connected to a prospect
- Identify warm introduction paths
- Map organizational hierarchies
- Track job changes and company news

Apollo provides standard contact data without this relationship pathway visibility.
