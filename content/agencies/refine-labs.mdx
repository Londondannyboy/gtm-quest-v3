# Refine Labs

Refine Labs is a B2B demand generation agency that focuses on creating demand rather than just capturing it. Founded by Chris Walker, they've pioneered the "dark funnel" concept and helped hundreds of B2B companies transform their marketing.

## What They Do

Refine Labs specializes in:

- **Demand Creation** - Building awareness and interest before intent exists
- **Content Strategy** - Podcast, video, and written content that educates
- **LinkedIn Advertising** - Paid campaigns that build brand awareness
- **Revenue Operations** - Aligning marketing and sales for attribution

## Their Approach

Unlike traditional demand gen agencies that focus on MQLs and gated content, Refine Labs emphasizes:

1. Ungated content that builds trust
2. Dark funnel attribution
3. Self-reported attribution surveys
4. Brand as a growth lever

## Best For

- B2B SaaS companies with $10M+ ARR
- Companies ready to invest in brand
- Teams frustrated with MQL-driven marketing
- Organizations with 6+ month sales cycles

## Notable Clients

They've worked with companies like Gong, Clari, and other leading B2B tech companies.
