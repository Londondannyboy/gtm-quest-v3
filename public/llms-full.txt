## SECTION 5: WHAT IS A GTM AGENCY?

### Definition

A Go-To-Market (GTM) agency is a specialized consultancy that helps B2B companies:

1. **Launch products** - Bring new products to market successfully
2. **Enter new markets** - Expand to new geographies or segments
3. **Build revenue engines** - Create predictable, scalable pipeline
4. **Align teams** - Connect product, marketing, and sales

### GTM Agency vs Marketing Agency

| Aspect | GTM Agency | Marketing Agency |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Focus | Full revenue cycle | Top-of-funnel awareness |
| Metrics | Pipeline, revenue, CAC | Impressions, leads, MQLs |
| Sales Integration | Deep alignment | Limited |
| Strategy Scope | End-to-end GTM | Campaign execution |

### GTM Agency vs Management Consultancy

| Aspect | GTM Agency | Consultancy |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Deliverable | Working systems | Slide decks |
| Execution | Hands-on | Advisory only |
| Cost | Lower | Much higher |
| Speed | Weeks | Months |

### When to Hire a GTM Agency

1. **Launching a new product or company** - Need to define market, audience, and messaging from scratch
2. **Entering new, unfamiliar markets** - Expanding geographically or into verticals where you lack expertise
3. **Growth has plateaued** - Existing strategies stopped working; need fresh approaches to break through
4. **Need to move faster than hiring allows** - Market window is narrow; can't wait months to hire and onboard
5. **Lack specialized expertise in-house** - Need ABM, Clay automation, RevOps, or other specialist skills
6. **Sales and marketing misalignment** - Departments not working together toward revenue goals
7. **Scaling challenges post-PMF** - Have product-market fit but struggling to scale predictably

### Benefits of Hiring a GTM Agency

1. **Increased Speed**
   - Accelerate launch timelines with proven playbooks and experienced teams
   - Reduce market entry risks by leveraging battle-tested strategies
   - Go live in weeks instead of months of internal development

2. **Alignment**
   - GTM agencies act as neutral experts who break down silos
   - They bring outside perspective that helps align departments
   - Focus on shared revenue goals rather than departmental metrics

3. **Expertise**
   - Specialized, proven knowledge from working across multiple companies
   - Prevents costly mistakes that first-time launchers commonly make
   - Deep experience in specific channels (ABM, outbound, paid media)

4. **Scalability**
   - Flexible capacity that scales with your needs
   - Ramp up for launches, scale down during optimization
   - Avoid fixed costs of full-time hires before you're ready

5. **Technology & Tools**
   - Access to expensive platforms (intent data, sales engagement, analytics)
   - Pre-built workflows and integrations that would take months to develop
   - Best practices from implementing across many clients
